### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Unify vanilla, react and next APIs so they can work together
  React and NextJS libraries now works together with `@nhost/nhost-js`. It also means the Nhost client needs to be initiated before passing it to the React provider.
  See the [React](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react#configuration) and [NextJS](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/nextjs/configuration) configuration documentation for additional information.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d8afde: Use `@nhost/react` as a peer dependency
  `@nhost/react` was bundled where it shouldn't. As a result, `@nhost/react-apollo` did not have access to the Nhost React context, leading to errors

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0d8afde]
  - @nhost/apollo@0.2.1
  - @nhost/react@0.2.1

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 207ae38: Rewrite of the Apollo GraphQL client

  - Introducing a new `@nhost/apollo` that will be reusable by other frameworks than React e.g. Vue
  - The new package works together with the `@nhost/client` and its new state management system
  - **BREAKING CHANGE** The react client `@nhost/react-apollo` is set to use the new `@nhost/client` package and won't work anymore with `@nhost/nhost-js`. See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/apollo) for further information.
