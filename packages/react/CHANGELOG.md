## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 1fb51a7: Rename user data hooks to make them all start with `userUser...`
  The hooks that help to access user data were not consistently named.
  The following hooks have been therefore renamed:

  - `useAvatarUrl` -> `useUserAvatarUrl`
  - `useDefaultRole` -> `useUserDefaultRole`
  - `useDisplayName` -> `useUserDisplayName`
  - `useEmail` -> `useUserEmail`
  - `useIsAnonymous` -> `useUserIsAnonymous`

  Their former names are still available for backwards compatibility, but are flagged as deprecated.

### Patch Changes

- @nhost/nhost-js@1.1.6

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 616e320: Remove `refreshToken` from the url when `autoSignIn` is set
  On startup, when the `autoSignIn` option is set to `true`, the client now removes it from the URL when the page loads.
- 1ce55c5: Add new hooks: `useDecodedAccessToken()`, `useHasuraClaims()`, and `useHasuraClaim(name: string)`
- 616e320: Look for the refresh token both in the query parameters and in the hash
  Until now, after redirecting from an email, Hasura-auth puts refresh tokens in the hash part of the url. It is a problem when using SSR as the hash is not accessible to the server. This behaviour is likely to change. As a result, the client now parses both the hash and the query parameters of the url.
  See [this issue](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/issues/148) to keep track of the progress on Hasura-auth.

### Patch Changes

- 49545c0: Remove filtering of `useLayoutEffect` from logs
  The `suppressConsoleMessage` method was meant to suppress incorrect `useLayoutEffect` messages raised on Nextjs server-side renderings. Its implementation had an impact on the normal functionning of logging (see [#447](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/issues/447)).
  This filtering was necessary when using former versions of xstate and can now be removed.

### Patch Changes

- 5ee395e: Ensure the session is destroyed when signout is done
  In the `useSignOut` hook, `signOut` now returns a promise. We are now sure the user session is empty once the promise is resolved.

### Minor Changes

- 7135aee: Add user and accessToken to authentication hooks

  Hooks that can complete a successful authentication now have two additional `user` and `accessToken` exported states:

  - `useSignInEmailPassword`
  - `useSignInAnonymous`
  - `useSignUpEmailPassword`

- 587eaff: Return a promise with the current context to hooks actions
  It is now possible to get the result of an action. Hook handlers return the action context in a promise.

  ```jsx
  const { signInEmailPasswordless, isError } = useSignInEmailPasswordless()
  const MyComponent = () => {
      return <div>
                  <button onClick={async () => {
                      const { isSuccess, isError, error } = await signInEmailPasswordless('johan@ikea.se')
                      if (isError) {
                          console.log(error)
                      }}}/>
                  {isError && <div>an error occurred</div>}
              <div>
  }

  ```

### Patch Changes

- 7cf875f: Deprecate the use of values sent as hook parameters

  Although handlers parameters of authentication hooks can be given when creating the hook, it is recommended to use them when executing the handler. For instance, instead of:

  ```js
  const { signInEmailPasswordless } = useSignInEmailPasswordless('nuno@fcporto.pt')
  signInEmailPasswordless()
  ```

  It is recommended to use the following syntax:

  ```js
  const { signInEmailPasswordless } = useSignInEmailPasswordless()
  signInEmailPasswordless('nuno@fcporto.pt')
  ```

  No breaking change has been introduced. For instance, `useSignUpEmailPassword('szilard@brussels.be','1234', options)` will appear as deprecated but will work, while `useSignUpEmailPassword(options)` will work too.

### Minor Changes

- 39df4d5: Deprecate `useAuthLoading` and introduce `useAuthenticationStatus`
  When using both `useAuthLoading` and `useAuthenticated` together, the hooks rerender independently from each other.
  As a result, when a user loads the page while he previously authenticated, the hooks values were chronologically:

  | isLoading | isAuthenticated |
  | --------- | --------------- |
  | `true`    | `false`         |
  | `false`   | `false`         |
  | `false`   | `true`          |

  The intermediate (`false`, `false`) is incorrect and is causing issues when using an authentication gate.

  It is therefore recommended to stop using `useAuthLoading`, and to use `useAuthenticationStatus` instead, in order to keep the loading state and the authentication in sync within the same hook.

  Usage:

  ```js
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuthenticationStatus()
  ```

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- @nhost/nhost-js@1.0.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSendVerificationEmail`

  While `useSignInEmailPassword` automatically sends a verification email (when the backend is configured to do so), an user may sometime want to request for an verification email to be sent again. See the [documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#send-email-verification) for further information about how to use this hook.

- 744fd69: Rename hooks and their methods to make them more explicit

  - `useEmailPasswordlessSignIn`
    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPasswordless`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPasswordless`
  - `useEmailPasswordSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInEmailPassword`
    - `signIn` renamed to `signInEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useEmailPasswordSignUp`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignUpEmailPassword`
    - `signUp` renamed to `signUpEmailPassword`
    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

  - `useAnonymousSignIn`

    - Hook renamed to `useSignInAnonymous`
    - renamed `signIn` to `signInAnonymous`

  - `useChangeEmail`

    - `needsVerification` renamed to `needsEmailVerification`

- 744fd69: Introducing `useSignInAnonymous`

  Anonymous Sign-In is a feature that allows users to get a temporary id without attaching yet any personal information such as an email or a passowrd.

  Anonymous users can then run GraphQL operations, with a specific `public` role that is distinct from the default `user` role. The anonymous can then "deanonymize" their account at a later stage in attaching the missing registration information and an authentication method.

  **Note** Anonymous Sign-In is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  **Note 2** The deanonymisation process is not yet available. This is also part of our roadmap.

  ```js
  const { signInAnonymous, isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error } = useSignInAnonymous()
  ```

  | `isSuccess`       | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` if the sign-up suceeded. Returns `false` if the new email needs to be verified first, or if an error occurred. |
  | `isError`         | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` if an error occurred.                                                                                          |
  | `error`           | {status: number, error: string, message: string} \| undefined | Provides details about the error.                                                                                             |

  #### Usage

  ```jsx
  import { useSignInAnonymous } from '@nhost/react'

  const Component = () => {
    const { signInAnonymous, isSuccess } = useSignInAnonymous(email, password)
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={signInAnonymous}>Anonymous sign-in</button>
        {isSuccess && <div>You are now signed in anonymously</div>}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

- 744fd69: Add options to `useProviderLink`

  Since [Hasura Auth version 0.4](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth/releases/tag/v0.4.0), it is possible to pass on options when signing up or signin in through an OAuth provider. It is now possible to determine these options in the `useProviderLink`, so it generates the right URL when using the provider links.

  See the [React documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/react/hooks#oauth-providers) for additional information.

- 744fd69: Time-based One-Time Password Multi-Factor Authentication

  **Note** MFA is not available out of the box yet in the [Nhost cloud](https://app.nhost.io/), but will be available in the near future.

  When enabled in the backend, users that signed up with an email and a password can opt-in for an additional authentication security measure.
  MFA can be activated in using the new `useConfigMfa` hook.

  Two methods has been also added to `useEmailPasswordSignIn`: when MFA is active, authentication won't be a success straight after signin up with an email and a password.
  The new `needsMfaOtp` will then appear as `true`, and the authentication will succeed only when the user will have sent back the OTP code with `sendMfaOtp(code:string)`.

  ```js
  const { generateQrCode, isGenerating, isGenerated, qrCodeDataUrl, activateMfa, isActivating, isActivated, isError, error } =
    useConfigMfa(code?: string)
  ```

  | `isGenerating`   | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` if the QR code is generating but not yet available                                               |
  | `isGenerated`    | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` when the QR code has been successfully generated and is available                                |
  | `qrCodeDataUrl`  | string                                                        | Returns the QR code as a [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) |
  | `activateMfa`    | (code?: string) => void                                       | Activate MFA from the code given by the MFA authentication application                                          |

  | `isActivated`    | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` when MFA has been successfully activated                                                         |
  | `isError`        | boolean                                                       | Returns `true` if an error occurred.                                                                            |
  | `error`          | {status: number, error: string, message: string} \| undefined | Provides details about the error.                                                                               |

  #### Usage

  ```jsx
  import { useConfigMfa } from '@nhost/react'
  import { useState } from 'react'

  export const Mfa: React.FC = () => {
    const [code, setCode] = useState('')
    const { generateQrCode, activateMfa, isActivated, isGenerated, qrCodeDataUrl } =
      useConfigMfa(code)

    return (
      <div>
        {!isGenerated && (
          <button block appearance="primary" onClick={generateQrCode}>
            Generate
          </button>
        )}
        {isGenerated && !isActivated && (
          <div>
            <img alt="qrcode" src={qrCodeDataUrl} />
            <input value={code} onChange={onChange={(event) => setCode(event.target.value)}} placeholder="Enter activation code" />
            <button block appearance="primary" onClick={activateMfa}>
              Activate
